# BgUtils POT Provider

> [!CAUTION]
> Providing a PO token does not guarantee bypassing 403 errors or bot checks, but it _may_ help your traffic seem more legitimate.

[Frequently Asked Questions](docs/FAQ.md)

A proof-of-origin token (POT) provider for [`yt-dlp`](//github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). We use [LuanRT's Botguard interfacing library](//github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) to generate the token.
This is used to bypass the "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" message when invoking `yt-dlp` from an IP address flagged by YouTube. See _[PO Token Guide](//github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide)_ for more details.

The system consists of two parts:

1. **Provider**: Two options -
   - (a) An HTTP server that generates the POT, and provides interfaces for the plugin to retrieve data from (easy setup + docker image provided)
   - (b) A POT generation script, which provides command line options for the plugin to invoke (the script requires transpiling before the plugin uses it)
2. **Provider plugin**: uses the POT plugin framework to retrieve data from the provider, allowing `yt-dlp` to simulate having passed the 'bot check'.

## Supported Clients

This provider only provides PO tokens for WEB clients.

See the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#which-clients-are-supported) for additional information.

## Installation

### Base Requirements

1. Requires [`yt-dlp`](//github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) `2025.05.22` or newer.

2. If using the Docker image for option (a) for the provider, the Docker runtime is required.  
   Otherwise, Node.js (>= 20) or Deno (>= 2.0.0) is required.

3. To obtain the provider and plugin files you will need one of these options:
   - a compressed archive and a utility to extract that archive
   - `git` to clone the repository

### 1. Set up the provider

There are two options for the provider; an always running POT generation HTTP server, and a POT generation script invoked when needed. The HTTP server option is simpler, faster, and comes with a prebuilt Docker image. **You only need to choose one option.**

You need to first install the repository unless you are using the Docker image for the HTTP server:

```shell
# Replace 1.2.2 with the latest version or the one that matches the plugin
git clone --single-branch --branch 1.2.2 https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.git
cd bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/
# If you are using Node:
npm ci
npx tsc
# Otherwise, if you want to use Deno:
deno install --allow-scripts=npm:canvas --frozen
```

#### (a) HTTP Server Option

The provider is a JavaScript HTTP server, listening on port 4416, by default. You can run it as a prebuilt Docker image or manually as a JavaScript application.

**Docker:**

Port 4416 is exposed to the host system by default. Pass `-p 1234:4416` in the docker run options (before the image name) to publish the server to port 1234 on the host system. Replace `[OPTIONS]` with the server command line options (usually this is not needed because you can use docker to publish the server to another port).

```shell
docker run --name bgutil-pot-provider --init -d -p 4416:4416 brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider [OPTIONS]
```

Our Docker image comes in two flavors: Node.js or Deno. The `:latest` tag defaults to Node.js, but you can specify an alternate version/flavor like so: `brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider:1.2.2-deno`. The `:node` tag also points to the latest Node.js image, and `:deno` points to the latest Deno image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that the Docker container's network is isolated from your local network by default. If you are using a local proxy server, it will not be accessible from within the container unless you pass `--net=host` as well.

**Native:**

Run the server with the selected JavaScript runtime with the following command, assuming you have changed into the `bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server` directory. Replace `[OPTIONS]` with the server command line options. For example, replace it with `--port 8080` to run the server on port 8080.

Node:

```shell
node build/main.js [OPTIONS]
```

Deno:

```shell
cd node_modules
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-ffi=. --allow-read=. ../src/main.ts [OPTIONS]
```

**Server Command Line Options**

- `-p, --port <PORT>`: The port (default: 4416) on which the server listens.

#### (b) Generation Script Option

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This method is not recommended for high concurrency usage. Every `yt-dlp` call incurs the overhead of spawning a new JavaScript runtime process to execute the script. This method also handles cache concurrency poorly.

1. Transpile the generation script to JavaScript:

```shell
# If you want to use this method without specifying `script_path` extractor argument
# on each yt-dlp invocation, clone/extract the source code into your home directory.
# Replace `~` with `%USERPROFILE%` if using Windows
cd ~
# Replace 1.2.2 with the latest version or the one that matches the plugin
git clone --single-branch --branch 1.2.2 https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.git
cd bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/
npm install
npx tsc
```

For this option, just make sure either `node` or `deno` is available in your `PATH`. Otherwise, use the yt-dlp option `--js-runtimes RUNTIME:PATH` to pass the path. `--no-js-runtimes` does NOT prevent the plugin from using the JavaScript runtime. The argument is only used to retrieve the path to the runtime.

### 2. Install the plugin

#### PyPI:

If `yt-dlp` is installed through `pip` or `pipx`, you can install the plugin with the following:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

#### Manual:

1. Download the plugin [archive](//github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/releases/latest/download/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.zip) file from the [latest release](//github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/releases/latest).
2. Install it by placing the zip file into one of the [plugin folders](//github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installing-plugins) used by `yt-dlp`.

## Usage

If using option (a) HTTP Server for the provider, and the default IP/port number, you can use `yt-dlp` like normal 🙂.

If you want to change the port number used by the provider server, use the `--port` option.

```shell
node build/main.js --port 8080
```

If changing the port or IP used for the provider server, pass it to `yt-dlp` via `base_url`

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilhttp:base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

If the tokens are no longer working, passing `disable_innertube=1` to `yt-dlp` restores the legacy behaviour and _might_ help

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilhttp:base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080;disable_innertube=1"
```

Note that when you pass multiple extractor arguments to one provider or extractor (in this case: `youtubepot-bgutilhttp`), they are to be separated by semicolons (`;`) as shown above. Multiple `--extractor-args` will **NOT** work for the same provider/extractor.

---

If using option (b) generation script for the provider, with the default script location in your home directory (i.e: `~/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider` or `%USERPROFILE%\bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`), you can also use `yt-dlp` like normal.

If you installed the script in a different location, pass it as the extractor argument `script_home` to `youtube-bgutilscript` for each `yt-dlp` call. `~` at the start of the path is automatically expanded.

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilscript:server_home=/path/to/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server"
```

---

We use a cache internally for all generated tokens when option (b) generation script is used. You can change the TTL (time to live) for the token cache with the environment variable `TOKEN_TTL` (in hours; default: 6). It's not currently possible to use different TTLs for different token contexts (can be `gvs`, `player`, or `subs`, see [Technical Details](//github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide#technical-details) from the PO Token Guide).  
That is, when using the script method, you can set a `TOKEN_TTL` before calling `yt-dlp` to use a custom TTL for PO Tokens.

---

If both methods are available for use, the option (a) HTTP server will be prioritized.

### Verification

To check if the plugin was installed correctly, you should see the `bgutil` providers in the verbose output from `yt-dlp`: `yt-dlp -v YOUTUBE_URL`.
