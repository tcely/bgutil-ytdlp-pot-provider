[Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#faq)

A proof-of-origin token (POT) provider for yt-dlp. We use [LuanRT's Botguard interfacing library](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) to generate the token.
This project was used to bypass the 'Sign in to confirm you're not a bot' message when invoking yt-dlp from an IP address flagged by YouTube. See _[PO Token Guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide)_ for more details.

The provider comes in two parts:

1. **Provider**: Two options -
   - (a) An HTTP server that generates the POT, and has interfaces for the plugin to retrieve data from (much faster, easy setup + docker image provided with Deno/Node.js support)
   - (b) A POT generation script, and has command line options for the plugin to invoke (needs to transpile the script)
2. **Provider plugin**: retrieves tokens from the provider and provides the token for yt-dlp using _[PO Token Provider Framework](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/pot/README.md)_.

## Installation

### Base Requirements

1. yt-dlp `2025.05.22` or above.

2. If using Docker image for option (a) for the provider, the Docker runtime is required.  
   Otherwise, Node.js (>= 20) or Deno (>= 2.0.0) is required. You will also need git to clone the repository.

### 1. Set up the provider

There are two options for the provider, an always running POT generation HTTP server, and a POT generation script invoked when needed. The HTTP server option is simpler, faster, and comes with a prebuilt Docker image. **You only need to choose one option.**

You need to first install the repository unless you are using the Docker image for the HTTP server:

```shell
# Replace 1.2.2 with the latest version or the one that matches the plugin
git clone --single-branch --branch 1.2.2 https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.git
cd bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/
# If you are using Node:
npm ci
npx tsc
# Otherwise, if you want to use Deno:
deno install --allow-scripts=npm:canvas --frozen
```

#### (a) HTTP Server Option

This is a JavaScript HTTP server, on port 4416 by default. You have two options for running it: as a prebuilt Docker image, or manually as a JavaScript application.

**Docker:**

Port 4416 is exposed to the host system by default. Pass `-p 1234:4416` in the docker run options (before the image name) to publish the server to port 1234 on the host system. Replace `[OPTIONS]` with the server command line options (usually this is not needed because you can use docker to publish the server to another port).

```shell
docker run --name bgutil-provider -d --init brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider [OPTIONS]
```

Our Docker image comes in two flavors: Node.js or Deno. The `:latest` tag defaults to Node.js, but you can specify an alternate version/flavor like so: `brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider:1.2.2-deno`. The `:node` tag also points to the latest Node.js image, and `:deno` points to the latest Deno image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that the docker container's network is isolated from your local network by default. If you are using a local proxy server, it will not be accessible from within the container unless you pass `--net=host` as well.

**Native:**

Run the server with the selected JavaScript runtime with the following command, assuming you have changed into the `bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server` directory. Replace `[OPTIONS]` with the server command line options. For example, replace it with `--port 8080` to run the server on port 8080.

Node:

```shell
node build/main.js [OPTIONS]
```

Deno:

```shell
cd node_modules
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-ffi=. --allow-read=. ../src/main.ts [OPTIONS]
```

**Server Command Line Options**

- `-p, --port <PORT>`: The port on which the server listens.

#### (b) Generation Script Option

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This method is NOT recommended for high concurrency usage. Every yt-dlp call incurs the overhead of spawning a new Node.js process to run the script. This method also handles cache concurrency poorly.

For this option, just make sure either `node` or `deno` is available in your `PATH`. Otherwise, use the yt-dlp option `--js-runtimes RUNTIME:PATH` to pass the path. `--no-js-runtimes` does NOT prevent the plugin from using the JavaScript runtime. The argument is only used to retrieve the path to the runtime.

### 2. Install the plugin

#### PyPI:

If yt-dlp is installed through `pip` or `pipx`, you can install the plugin with the following:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

#### Manual:

1. Download [`bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.zip`](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/releases/latest/download/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.zip) from [the latest release](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/releases/latest).
2. Install it by placing the zip into one of the [yt-dlp plugin folders](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installing-plugins).

## Usage

If using option (a) HTTP Server for the provider, and the default IP/port number (http://127.0.0.1:4416), you can use yt-dlp like normal 🙂.

If changing the port or IP used for the provider server, pass it to yt-dlp via `base_url`

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilhttp:base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

If the tokens are no longer working, passing `disable_innertube=1` to yt-dlp restores the legacy behaviour and _might_ help

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilhttp:base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080;disable_innertube=1"
```

Note that when you pass multiple extractor arguments to one provider or extractor, they are to be separated by semicolons(`;`) as shown above.

---

If using option (b) script for the provider, with the default script location in your home directory (i.e: `~/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider` or `%USERPROFILE%\bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`), you can also use yt-dlp like normal.

If you installed the script in a different location, pass it as the extractor argument `server_home` to `youtube-bgutilscript` for each yt-dlp call. `~` at the start of the path is automatically expanded.

```shell
--extractor-args "youtubepot-bgutilscript:server_home=/path/to/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server"
```

---

We use a cache internally for all generated tokens when option (b) script is used. You can change the TTL (time to live) for the token cache with the environment variable `TOKEN_TTL` (in hours, defaults to 6). It's currently impossible to use different TTLs for different token contexts (can be `gvs`, `player`, or `subs`, see [Technical Details](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide#technical-details) from the PO Token Guide).  
That is, when using the script method, you can pass a `TOKEN_TTL` to yt-dlp to use a custom TTL for PO Tokens.

---

If both methods are available for use, the option (a) HTTP server method will be prioritized.

### Verification

To check if the plugin was installed correctly, you should see the `bgutil` providers in yt-dlp's verbose output: `yt-dlp -v YOUTUBE_URL`.

```
[debug] [youtube] [pot] PO Token Providers: bgutil:http-1.2.2 (external), bgutil:script-node-1.2.2 (external), bgutil:script-deno-1.2.2 (external, unavailable)
```

### FAQ

#### I'm getting errors during `npm ci` on Termux

For provider versions >=1.2.0, you may have issues while installing the `canvas` dependency on Termux. The Termux environment is missing a `android_ndk_path` and two packages by default. Run the following commands to setup the dependencies correctly.

```shell
mkdir ~/.gyp && echo "{'variables':{'android_ndk_path':''}}" > ~/.gyp/include.gypi
pkg install libvips xorgproto
```
